# Etch-a-Sketch!

This website creates a grid which gets painted over when you run your mouse over it. There are three different color options:
- Black: the original
- Random: assigns a random color to each sqaure you run your mouse over
- 10% Black: makes the square 10% more black every time you run your mouse over it

Have fun drawing!
